Healthcare Data Analysis – Financial Risk and Cost Evaluation
1. Project Overview
The healthcare sector generates massive amounts of data related to patients, encounters, procedures, and payers. Efficiently analyzing this data is critical to reducing costs, identifying financial risks, and improving resource allocation.

This project focuses on financial risk assessment and cost evaluation in healthcare using SQL for data analysis and Tableau for visualization.
2. Objectives
- To evaluate the financial risks associated with patient encounters and payer contributions.
- To identify high-cost procedures and encounters driving overall expenditure.
- To analyze payer performance and contribution trends.
- To provide interactive dashboards for stakeholders to track costs and risks effectively.
3. Tools & Technologies
- SQL (Microsoft SQL Server): Data cleaning, transformation, and advanced analysis using CTEs, window functions, and joins.
- Tableau: Visualization of key insights through interactive dashboards.
4. Dataset Description
The dataset is derived from a healthcare database containing:
- Patients Table: Patient demographics.
- Encounters Table: Hospital visits, admission and discharge details.
- Procedures Table: Medical procedures and their costs.
- Payers Table: Insurance providers and payment contributions.
- Organizations Table: Healthcare organizations and facilities.

5. Methodology
Step 1 – Data Preparation (SQL)
- Removed duplicates and standardized missing values.
- Normalized cost fields and ensured consistency in date/time formats.
- Created Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for high-cost encounters and payer contributions.

Step 2 – Data Analysis (SQL Queries)
- Identified top 10 high-cost encounters using window functions.
- Calculated payer contribution percentages and highlighted payers with high risk exposure.
- Analyzed average encounter duration and linked it to cost implications.
- Detected yearly trends in procedures and costs.

Step 3 – Visualization (Tableau)
- Built dashboards to present insights:
  • Financial Risk Dashboard: High-cost patients, encounters, and payer risks.
  • Cost Analysis Dashboard: Procedure cost breakdown and encounter trends.
  • Payer Contribution Dashboard: Comparative view of insurance provider contributions.
6. Key Insights
- A small percentage of patients and encounters account for majority of costs (Pareto effect).
- Certain procedures drive disproportionate financial risks, requiring negotiation with payers.
- Some payers consistently under-contribute, leading to higher financial burden on providers.
- Longer hospital stays correlate with higher financial risks, suggesting the need for efficiency improvements.


7. Outcomes
- Developed a data-driven framework to evaluate financial risks in healthcare.
- Identified cost-saving opportunities by highlighting inefficiencies.
- Delivered interactive Tableau dashboards for real-time decision-making.
8. Challenges
- Handling missing and inconsistent patient and encounter data.
- Ensuring accurate mapping between procedures and payer contributions.
- Optimizing complex SQL queries for large datasets.
9. Future Scope
- Integration with machine learning models for predictive risk analysis.
- Incorporating NLP-based analysis on physician notes for better insights.
- Expanding dashboards with real-time data pipelines for live monitoring.
10. Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of SQL for in-depth analysis and Tableau for visualization in addressing financial challenges within healthcare. By identifying cost drivers and financial risks, healthcare organizations can optimize resources, negotiate better payer contracts, and enhance patient care efficiency.
